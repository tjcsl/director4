    WARNING: Do not use this for anything other than internal connections!

    If ssl_settings is None, this function returns None. Otherwise,
    ssl_settings must be a dictionary in the following format:
    {
        "cafile": "<path to CA file used to verify server certificates>",
        "client_cert": {
            "certfile": "<path to client certificate file>",  # Required
            "keyfile": "<path to client private key file>",  # Taken from certfile if not passed
            "password": "<private key password>",  # Required if private key is encrypted
        },
    }

    (The "client_cert" parameter is optional.)

    Some additional parameters are set on the SSL context:
     - It is set up for use authenticating servers (creating client-side sockets)
     - A certificate is required and validated upon reception.
     - HOSTNAME CHECKING IS DISABLED. As a result, "cafile" MUST point to a trusted CA!
       It is recommended to use a self-signed certificate on the remote server and point
       "cafile" to this certificate.
