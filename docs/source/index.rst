Director4 Documentation
=======================

Director 4.0 is a website management and hosting platform (based on the former
Director platform) that is designed to scale. It replaces the former Director
platform which had problems with performance, scalability, and ease of use.

.. note::

  From now onwards, we may refer to the Director 4.0 platform as "Director",
  with the understanding that we are referring to the 4.0 version.
