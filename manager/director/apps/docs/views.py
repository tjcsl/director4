# *** WARNING WARNING WARNING: Read this carefully before making any URL routing changes ***
# Here's how routing works.
# Let's say we have the following setup:
# - a.py
# - b.md
# - c.d/
#   - index.md
# Requests to /a.py will return the contents of a.py because there's an extension in
#   the last portion of the URL, and that triggers a check for static files.
# Requests to /a.py/ will 404 because the slash "hides" the extension. THIS IS VERY
#   IMPORTANT.
# Requests to /b will 302 to /b/.
# Requests to /b/ will render b.md and return the result.
# Requests to /c.d will 302 to /c.d/, but only once we have:
#   1. Checked for a *file* named "c.d" and found nothing.
#   2. Checked for a page named "c.d" and confirmed that it exists.
# Requests to /c/ will render c/index.md and return the result.
# Requests to /NOEXIST will 302 to /NOEXIST/ because there is no extension to trigger
#   a static file check
# Requests to /NOEXIST/ will 404 because NOEXIST.md does not exist and NOEXIST/index.md
#   does not exist.
# Requests to /NOEXIST.py will 404. They will NOT 302 to /NOEXIST.py/. If we did that,
#   then if we later added a static file with that name, things might break (in
#   certain weird circumstances).
